# sklearn-aio
Scikit-learn modelling but simplified somewhat.

I often use the same workflow when using sklearn in kaggle competitions (create model, tune it, and make submission). 
It became clear to me that this repetitive process can be simplified (somewhat), where I only need to specify which
model I'd want, how to tune it, how to evaluate it, and so on.

I also plan to extend this to preprocessing as well.
